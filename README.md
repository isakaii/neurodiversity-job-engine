# AI-driven Neurodiversity Job Matcher
The AI-driven Neurodiversity Job Matcher seeks to automate the job seeker-job position matching process for the Stanford Neurodiversity Project's Neurodiversity at Work clinical trial. The Natural Language Processing (NLU) based matching algorithm aims to generate optimal matches for all job seekers and positions to maximize the potential of neurodiverse individuals by matching them with job positions based on their overall strengths and experiences. 

About This Project:
The AI-driven Neurodiversity Job Matcher seeks to compare job descriptions with O*NET, a national database of occupational information, and use cross-comparison methods to extract competency match percentages between a job's required and preferred qualifications and the candidate's experience. CareerOneStop's Competency Model from the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration is used as a basis for classification and/or keyword extraction.

Through an integration with a database of job descriptions and resumes from Google Cloud's NLU platform, this project uses entity resolution to determine match percentages between job descriptions and candidates. Entity resolution allows the job matching engine to recognize when a candidateâ€™s work experience and a job requirement were referring to the same real-world entities.
